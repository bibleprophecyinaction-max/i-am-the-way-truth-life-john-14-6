# I Am the Way, the Truth & the Life – John 14:6

Many voices in the world claim to offer spiritual truth.

But Jesus declared:
“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes unto the Father, but by Me.”

Christ is the only way to God.
He is the Truth — the fulfillment of God’s promises.
He is the Life — the giver of eternal life.

Through His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, He obtained eternal redemption for us.

Salvation is not found in religion, works, or human leaders — but in Jesus Christ alone.

If you trust in Him, you will receive forgiveness and everlasting life.
